Vanity search
==================

This is a small ruby script that I wrote to perform a daily monitor of the number of google search results for various search terms. Hence an automatic vanity search to see how often you're mentioned on Google. Once the results are collected it uses [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) to graph the history.

The only problem with this is that the google ajax search reports far lower numbers than the web google search but I couldn't find any better way to get the number of search results for a given term

I have limited experience with bash, ruby, javascript and d3.js so I may be doing everything completely wrong.
